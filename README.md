# Fraudulent-Transaction
Several models are trained and evaluated to find how effectively they predict instances of fraud

In this project I will train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict in- stances of fraud using data based on this dataset from Kaggle. Each row in fraud_data.csv corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables V1 through V28 as well as Amount which is the amount of the transaction. The target is stored in the class column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.
